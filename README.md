# Introduction

A basic todo-list project. Users can:  
- Add and delete todo items; the items are stored with Web Storage API localStorage and persist when page is refreshed or closed and reopened.  
- Store todo items in different files. Currently, empty files are not loaded when page is refreshed.    
- Display further details of a todo item by clicking on them  

## WIP:
- More CSS styling  
- Displaying items based on priority  
- Ability to mark item as complete
